# Welcome to the IBM GBS Public Service Cloud Application Innovation Challenge for 2018!

## Background

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has new regulation for small unmanned aircrafts other than a model aircraft to be registered with the FAA prior to use. Previously, the FAA would have hobbyists and public users mail in a form with information about themselves and the drone. With the increase in drone owners, the FAA has asked you to create a website for all hobbyists and public users to self-register personal unmanned aircraft (drones).

Note: This challenge event is a simulation, but the FAA really does have this website: https://faadronezone.faa.gov/#/

## Challenge
Using the IBM Cloud platform, build an application that meets all the requirements in the user stories to address the client's needs. Then develop a 10 minute presentation showcasing your application and the benefits it brings to the FAA.  

The requirements, in the form of Agile User Stories, are available online as GitHub Issues on this repository. https://github.com/CAIChallenge2018/CAIChallenge2018/issues

Focus on getting the requirements met. Like the Agile Manifesto says - we value working software. Feel free to start refining things after you finish all the stories (and share with us what you did and why). 

## Getting Started

Your fictious team lead has assigned you the task of working through as many of the user stories as you can during the Challenge time. Your team lead has also created starter pack projects for you so that you don't have to start from scratch. There are three starter packs available - two for the application (Java/Spring Boot and Node.js/Express) and one for the database. You may choose to use them or not, it is up to you. If you want to use other tech stacks you can. The starters have readmes available for you to review.

The only constraint is if you run a database in IBM Cloud it must be Postgres because that is what your team lead left instructions for :)

### IBM Cloud Account
You should have received an invite within the last 24 hours to join the IBM Cloud account we're using for the challenge. You need that account to run through any of the IBM Cloud command line tools to deploy your application and provision your database. 

If you don't have that, first log in to the console (https://console.bluemix.net) and see if you have access. If you already created a IBM Cloud account under your email then you will *not* get an e-mail invitation, so you might already have access. 

If you still don't have the account or access, ask for help. 

### IBM Cloud CLI
The IBM Cloud CLI tools are required. Get them from https://console.bluemix.net/docs/cli/index.html#overview

### Database
The database starter readme has instructions for provisioning your database service from IBM Cloud. Start these early on, even if you're not going to use the rest of the database starter, because it can take anywhere from 5-30 minutes to provision the database. https://github.com/CAIChallenge2018/CAIChallenge2018/tree/master/database#creating-a-database

### Support
Some support is available, try asking. Requirement clarification questions could also be asked as comments on the Issue itself. 

### Your first step

Fork this repository on GitHub, clone it down to your machine, and get coding! Good luck!

PS - don't forget to push your code back up to github.
